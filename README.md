## How to use this Repo

This repo has three branches:

* master
* final
* final-all-in-one

The `master` branch has a starter template for creating what is in the `final` branch.  The `final-all-in-one` is a single `app-all.js` file that functions completely alone, while the `final` branch is a refactored version of that.

## How to run the app

When you go to each branch, the `README.md` will show you how to start the app.

The `master` branch is incomplete and you can follow the written or video tutorials to complete:
